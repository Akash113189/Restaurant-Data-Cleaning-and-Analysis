# Restaurant Data Cleaning and Analysis

## Overview
This project involves cleaning a dataset of restaurant metadata obtained from Kaggle using Python and the Pandas library. The cleaned data can be used for clustering restaurants into segments, analyzing cuisine trends, and conducting cost vs. benefit analysis. Additionally, this project prepares the data for visualization using Tableau, enabling actionable insights.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values, handled duplicates, and standardized data formats for better usability.
- **Analysis Preparation**: Extracted meaningful information for clustering, segmentation, and cost analysis.
- **Tableau Integration**: Cleaned dataset ready for creating visually interactive dashboards.
- **Practical Application**: The project supports business decisions, such as identifying popular cuisines, comparing costs, and segmenting restaurants based on metadata.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Content**: Restaurant names, cuisine types, cost information, and metadata for clustering and analysis.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data cleaning and preparation.
- **Pandas**: Primary library used for handling and transforming the dataset.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment for the data cleaning process.
- **Tableau**: Planned tool for creating interactive dashboards based on the cleaned data.

## Usage
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - View the cleaning process in the Jupyter Notebook file
   - Understand how missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies are addressed.
2. **Insights and Visualization**:
   - Utilize the cleaned dataset for clustering, cost-benefit analysis, and Tableau dashboards.
   - The cleaned data enables identifying trends in restaurant metadata and making data-driven decisions.

## Repository Structure
- `Cleaned The Resturent data.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the data cleaning process.
- `Cleaned_Resturent_Data.xlsx`: The cleaned dataset ready for analysis and visualization.
- `Pre_Clean_Restaurant names and Metadata.csv`: The dataset before cleaning.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Future Enhancements
- Develop a Tableau dashboard for visualizing restaurant clusters, cost patterns, and cuisine trends.
- Integrate additional data sources for richer insights and predictive analysis.

## How This Helps
By using this project, users can:
- Gain insights into restaurant trends.
- Perform cost vs. benefit analysis for decision-making.
- Easily visualize metadata and trends with Tableau dashboards.
