# Restaurant Data Cleaning and Analysis

# Overview

This project focuses on cleaning a dataset of restaurant metadata obtained from Kaggle using Python and the Pandas library. The goal is to preprocess the raw data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies, ensuring the dataset is clean and structured for future analysis.

# Key Features

	•	Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized data formats for consistency and usability.
	•	Preprocessed Dataset: Provided a cleaned dataset that is ready for analysis or integration into any analytics pipeline.
	•	Scalable Workflow: The cleaning process is modular and reusable for similar datasets.

# Dataset

	•	Source: Kaggle
	•	Content: Restaurant names, cuisine types, cost information, and additional metadata.
	•	Format: The cleaned dataset is provided in .xlsx format for ease of use.

# Tools and Technologies

	•	Python: For data preprocessing and cleaning.
	•	Pandas: The primary library used for handling, transforming, and cleaning the dataset.
	•	Jupyter Notebook: Environment used for performing and documenting the data cleaning process.

# Repository Structure

	•	Cleaned_Restaurant_Data.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook detailing the step-by-step cleaning process.
	•	Cleaned_Restaurant_Data.xlsx: Cleaned dataset ready for further use.
	•	Pre_Clean_Restaurant_Metadata.csv: Original dataset before cleaning.
	•	README.md: Project documentation.

# Usage

	1.	Explore the Cleaning Process:
	•	Open the Jupyter Notebook (Cleaned_Restaurant_Data.ipynb) to see how missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies were handled.
	2.	Utilize the Cleaned Dataset:
	•	The cleaned dataset is available in .xlsx format for direct use in any analytics or visualization tool.

# How This Helps

By using this project, users can:

	•	Work with a well-structured and clean dataset for advanced analytics.
	•	Save time on preprocessing and focus on insights or modeling tasks.
	•	Ensure data consistency and reliability for downstream applications.
